# Daraja HTTP Server Framework

Daraja is a flexible HTTP server framework for Object Pascal, based on the non-visual HTTP server component in the free open source library Internet Direct (Indy).

Daraja provides the core foundation for serving HTTP resources of all content-types such as HTML pages, images, scripts, web service responses etc. by mapping resource paths to your own code. Your code then can create the response content, or let the framework serve a static file.

## Resource handlers (TdjWebComponent)

A **resource handler** is responsible for the generation of the HTTP response matching a specific client request. The routing between the actual HTTP request and the resource handler is defined by 'mapping' rules.
For example, a resource handler could be mapped to `/context1/index.html` with an **absolute path** mapping:

```pascal
  Context1.Add(TIndexPageResource, '/index.html');
```

There are two other supported mapping types: **prefix mapping** ('/sub1/*', '/sub2/*' ...) and **suffix mapping** ('*.html', '*.pdf' ...). All mappings are checked in a defined order to find the responsible resource handler.

## Resource filters (TdjWebFilter)

In addition to resource handlers, the application may also include resource filters. With filters, HTTP traffic can be modified in many ways, such as:
* Detect missing authorization, and forward to a login page.
* Set or remove HTTP headers depending on conditions.
* Pre- or postprocess the request body content, to remove or insert data.

All mapping types may also be used for resource filters.
